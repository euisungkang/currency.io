# Overview
currency.io 🌐 is not just a website; it's a **vision** 🌟✨. A **marvel** in fintech 💰🚀, crafted with the advanced SvelteKit framework 🛠️💻 and **strategically** hosted on Vercel 🌍📡 for **supreme**, **unparalleled** innovation 🚀🌈, employing a **serverless architecture** ☁️🔄, and harnessing the **bleeding edge** 🩸✂️ dual power of **Static Site Generation (SSG)** 🏗️💥 and **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** 🖥️⚡ for an incredib.........

........ it's just a currency converter I whipped up 😬<br>

# Problem
### 1. Converting numbers in Korean is confusing...
... especially when converting from western methods of counting. For example, Koreans count numbers by 10 thousands (10 thousand = 1 만). There is no reliable currency converter, or even just a number 'translator' for this specific use case.
#### Converting and understanding $123,456,789,010 USD into ₩ KRW:

### 2. Most currency converters focus on having the largest selection of currencies.
currency.io is just a lightweight converter for English/Korean speakers.

### 3. A very special someone ♥️ said she wanted a tool to solve problems 1 and 2
so i get the job done. no questions asked.

### 4. Last, but not least, curiosity
javascript (node, express, angular, react) has been a core part of my journey as a developer; however, work shifted my focus to other places like Java Spring, and python. I've watched the emergence of some really exciting JS frameworks such as Next, Nest, and particularly Svelte/Sveltekit. During my spare time on the weekends, I took up the challenge to explore the newest technologies in the rapidly changing JS world. Plus, I get to make the person who originally requested this project happy 🙂.
